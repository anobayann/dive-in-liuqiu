      <h1>How to go to Xiao Liuqiu Island?</h1>
      <hr class="divider light my-4" />
      <h2> The faster way to reach little Liuqiu</h2>
      <img src="assets/img/hsr.png" alt="hsr taiwan png" class="my-4" width="220vw">
      <h3>Did you know that you can be in Liqiu island in only 3h30 from Taipei? Just check this out!</h3>
      <p> There is a 25 minutes ferry leaving frequently from Donggang Pier (you can find the boat schedules below on the ferry section). <br>
         If you come from Taipei, the faster way would be to take the HSR train, It can reach Zuoying station, in Kaoshiung in 1h30 only! You can look at the schedules in english on this website <a href="https://en.thsrc.com.tw/" target="_blank" title="hsr schedules">https://en.thsrc.com.tw/</a><br>
          Once you are in Zuoying station, there is a direct bus (9127D) going to the ferry station of Dongang without any stop between for 120nt, the journey is about 45 minutes. (You can find the schedules below on the bus section). <br> 
          An other option would be to take the taxi, who can be private taxi, uber or a shared taxi for 200nt per person.<br>
           So for exemple if you take the 7h31 train from Taipei, you ll reach Zuoying station at 9h05 then take the bus at 9h30, you will be at Donggang station before 10h15, take the ferry at 10h30 and you will be at Xiaoliuqiu Island before 11am, Amazing right!

      </div>
      <p>As you can see on the pictures just above, you shoud follow the exit 2 when you are inside Zuoying station and you will see the office who sell the bus tickets for Donggang and Kenting. You can also buy it directly on the bus. The bus station is located right in front the exit 2.</p>

      <img src="assets/img/carpng.png" alt="car taiwan png" width="180vw" class="my-4">
      <p>If you prefer to drive to Liuqiu, first you have to know that you can't bring your car to the island unless you are resident. And even the residents use mostly a motorbike there, driving vehicules are not very convenients. You can park your car in Donggang for 100nt a day, the best way would be to go to this place right in front of the pier, they come with you to the parking area and bring you back to the pier free of charge, same when you come back, here is the phone number. You can also park your car on the city parking but it is way more expensive and less convenient.</p>

      <h2>Going to Liuqiu by bus</h2>
      <img src="assets/img/buspng.png" alt="bus png taiwan" width="200vw" class="my-4">
      <p>To reach Dongang ferry station by bus the most convenient is to take the bus 2197D from Zuying station in Kaoshung, it is a direct bus for 120nt per person, the journey take about 45 minutes. You can see the bus schedules on picture below. You can take this bus also to come back in Zuoying, the bus station is located just beside the ferry terminal, the schedules is on the second column as we take the bus from Donggang ferry terminal.
         There is also a public bus (9117)from Zili station in Kaoshung passing by Kashung station going to Kenting. You should stop in Pingtung bus Donggang station then take a the bus 503, take a taxi or walk for about 15 minutes to Donggang ferry terminal. This is a bit long because the bus from Kaoshung will do many stop but it is a cheap way to come and can be a good option if you are living in the south of Kaoshung. </p>

      <h2>Going to Liuqiu by taxi</h2>
      <img src="assets/img/taxi.png" alt="bus png taiwan" width="200vw" class="my-4">
      <p>If you are already in Kaoshung city, there is many way for you to go to Donggang, by taxi which will is the most expensive option but the faster as well. An other fast way would be to take the mrt to the last station ........ then take a taxi there. By bus you can see all the infos above, taking the bus from from Zuoying it is usually what i do, as it is cheap and very convenient. And for the most adventurous, in motorobike from kaoshung, you can take it on the ferry for 100nt and you will probably need one on the island anyway.</p>

      <h2>Transportation in Xiaoliuqiu</h2>
      <img src="assets/img/scooter.png" alt="bus png taiwan" width="200vw" class="my-4">
      <p>The island is tiny but it is better to have a vehicule to move around, there is few car in the island. Most of tourists and locals have a motorbike, there is plenty of company renting scooters here. There is also lot of electric motorbike for rent and station around the island to charge them which poluate less and can be convenient for foreigners as you don't need a local driving licence.
         You can also find electric bicycle and bicycle, but the ilsand is not flat, so i don't really suggest you the bicycle option. A trick to pay a bit cheaper is to buy your return ferry ticket with the motorbike rental to the women outside the ferry station.</p>
